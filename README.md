# WebLab4
This is a web application development project that is based on _Vue_ and _Electron_ using JavaScript. Django REST Framework (DRF) was used to provide a secure and easy-to-maintain backend. The interface uses HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The application follows best practices, including clear separation of tasks, modular design and version control using Git, creating a reliable and scalable framework for web development. ðŸš€

## **Our Idea:**
We made a game in the **Bullet Hell** genre.  The main idea for the gameplay is the generation of "lasers" with different patterns of hanging
